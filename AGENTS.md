# Agent Guidelines

## Scope
- Focus on workspace commands and documentation.
- Treat this repository as the primary subject; do not use it to manage external projects.

## Behavioral Notes
- Prefer improving or adding command workflows, CLI helpers, and documentation.
- Avoid expanding into training, model execution, or dataset management beyond command tooling.
- Keep changes minimal and aligned to the workspace utilities.

## Command Context
- Commands should infer inputs from the current working directory when possible.
- Favor sensible defaults based on the folder (project or dataset) being used.
